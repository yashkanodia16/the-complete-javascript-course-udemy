# Budgety JavaScript App :moneybag:

Budgety is a JavaScript project which I have done during the course The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects! by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. 

Budgety is a simple budget tracker app. It allows user to input incomes & expenses and see how the complete budget changes due to custom insertions.

I am open to any suggestions about a code and how the app can be improved.
